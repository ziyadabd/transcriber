1. Install Required Libraries
Install the transcribe-anything library and its dependencies.
Use libraries like Flask for the backend and Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests.
Use a simple frontend framework like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or consider frameworks like React for a more dynamic UI.
bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn transcribe-anything

2. Setup GPU for the Host
Ensure your environment supports GPU usage:

Install and configure CUDA and cuDNN.
Verify the availability of the GPU using libraries like torch if required by transcribe-anything.


5. Notes for GPU Integration
Ensure your environment is correctly configured for GPU usage:

Install CUDA and cuDNN on your host machine.
Verify GPU availability with:
python
Copy code
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
If transcribe-anything supports GPU, it should automatically leverage it if CUDA is installed.
